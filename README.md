###Bike Safety###
This app was designed in order to educate the user with a few general tips on how to safely ride a bike on the road.
It is a very simply Android app that was done in order to introduce some of the basic elements of Android development.
The app was created as the final project for the Udacity Android Development for Beginners course.

No external libraries or additional dependencies are needed in order to run the app. Simply compile the code and 
run using Android Studio.

The project has also been uploaded onto the following GitHub repo:
https://github.com/BIGxRED/BikeSafety 

A few special things worth mentioning about this app:
	1. Prior to creating the app, I had some experience with Java. Hence, in some instances, the coding that was used
	is more advanced than what was taught in the course. 
	2. I feel like using 3 Intent objects was excessive for the goal of this project. However, I had done this
	in order to learn more about Intents since they were not covered in the course. I plan on taking the Android
	Development nanodegree program, which contains more advanced material than this course. Therefore, using
	Intents was a way for me to get a little ahead prior to diving into the nandegree.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this app, please let me know.
