    <string name="introBodyText">\tIn todayâ€™s time, biking is becoming a more common means of transportation than ever before.
        The number of bikers has grown significantly within the past few years: between 2000 and 2009, the number of regular bike
        commuters increased by 70% across the United States. \n\n\tHowever, it is important not to rush into the stream of all the bikers
        around you before considering your safety. Biking can be just as safe as driving as long as you follow the laws and
        apply common sense.</string>
